However, they don’t know since they’ve never tasted the moon before. While Cookie Monster is wondering how to get to the moon, Gordon enters with former astronaut, Buzz Aldrin, who explains that the moon is made out of rocks. Although it’s not a cookie, the moon is a beautiful and exciting place to look up at from Earth. Cookie Monster realizes that the moon is not a cookie and that he wouldn’t even want to eat it so the moon can continue to shine down on Earth."

Baby Bear tests his hypothesis that they can turn into a different animal depending on the animal sound they make. Through his experiment, he finds out that his guess is correct!
