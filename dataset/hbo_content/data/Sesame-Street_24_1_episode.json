They watch Slimey ride off in the worm school bus. Gina brings the dirt to school and she and Telly peek in the tiny worm school windows. Oscar reminisces meeting Slimey in the park for the first time and has conflicting feelings that Slimey is growing up quickly and going to school already. During recess, all the worms go to the courtyard to play tag. Big Bird sees one little worm is left out. Slimey notices, too, and invites the little worm, as well as Big Bird, to play. While learning the alphabet, they are disrupted by Snuffy jumping. When Slimey gets home, he tells Oscar what he learned at school such as cooperation and the word “no”."
