But Cookie has a hard time parting with his cookies and he no longer wants to sell them. Chris then finds an ad to be Horatio Elephant’s dance partner, but turns it down since he will be paid in peanuts instead of money. When Chris is about to give up, he sees a “Help Wanted” sign hanging in Hooper’s Store. Alan says he can use Chris’s help to stock shelves, work the register, and sweep.
