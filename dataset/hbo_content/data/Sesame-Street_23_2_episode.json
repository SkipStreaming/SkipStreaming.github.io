They watch Slimey ride off in the worm school bus. Gina brings the dirt to school and she and Telly peek in the tiny worm school windows. Oscar reminisces meeting Slimey in the park for the first time and has conflicting feelings that Slimey is growing up quickly and going to school already. During recess, all the worms go to the courtyard to play tag. Big Bird sees one little worm is left out. Slimey notices, too, and invites the little worm, as well as Big Bird, to play. While learning the alphabet, they are disrupted by Snuffy jumping. When Slimey gets home, he tells Oscar what he learned at school such as cooperation and the word “no”."

Duck Ellington, Wynton Marsalis, and The Sesame Street All-Animal Jazz Ensemble perform first. The various animals sing a melody about the different sounds animals use to communicate with each other. Then Wynton says he will perform not one, but twenty numbers! He plays twenty notes on his trumpet as The Count counts them. He then plays another uptempo riff where The Count is challenged to quickly count to over 230. Biff and Sully & The Hardhats perform next. They perform a song Biff wrote to thank the birds for their beautiful singing called For the Birds. The last performer of the day, Bobby McFerrin, closes with his song called Tweet in the Mornin’."

Elmo and Merry imagine that they have cars with many features including loud horns, radios, bells, and sirens.
