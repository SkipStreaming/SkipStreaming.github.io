He starts off well, but he falls twice and loses the race. The next event is up-and-downhill skiing. Slimey gets up the hill easily, but then falls going downhill and gets disqualified. In the speed skating event, he falls five times and loses the event. Oscar and Slimey are hopeful for the next event, the luge, as it is Slimey’s best event, and he has been practicing for years! The race was going so well, until he fell off his sled. Unfortunately, he falls in the last shape-skating event while skating and making a circle. Even though Slimey loses each event, he always gets up and tries again, so he wins the gold star in falling down."
