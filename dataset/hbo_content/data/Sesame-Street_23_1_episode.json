He orders porridge and tells Gina he is tired of Goldilocks eating his porridge, breaking his chair, and sleeping in his bed. As he starts eating, Goldilocks enters and orders porridge too. Frustrated, Baby Bear storms off to get away from her. Anywhere Baby Bear goes, anything he wants, anything he does, Goldilocks is there doing the same. She moves into the trash can he wanted, teaches the class he wanted to take, and even sells porridge next to Baby Bear’s porridge stand! Baby Bear is so annoyed with Goldilocks, he packs up his bag to move home. When Goldilocks tells Baby Bear she follows him because she wants to be his friend, he accepts her friendship! Together, Baby Bear and Goldilocks return to the forest."

Oscar reminisces meeting Slimey in the park for the first time and has conflicting feelings that Slimey is growing up quickly and going to school already. During recess, all the worms go to the courtyard to play tag. Big Bird sees one little worm is left out. Slimey notices, too, and invites the little worm, as well as Big Bird, to play. While learning the alphabet, they are disrupted by Snuffy jumping. When Slimey gets home, he tells Oscar what he learned at school such as cooperation and the word “no”."

Then Wynton says he will perform not one, but twenty numbers! He plays twenty notes on his trumpet as The Count counts them. He then plays another uptempo riff where The Count is challenged to quickly count to over 230. Biff and Sully & The Hardhats perform next. They perform a song Biff wrote to thank the birds for their beautiful singing called For the Birds. The last performer of the day, Bobby McFerrin, closes with his song called Tweet in the Mornin’."
