As they arrive at Hooper’s Store, Alan explains how the number zero helps him keep track of what he needs to order because zero means he ran out of something. Chris and the baseball team also ask Zero to stand by the scoreboard to help keep score. This makes Zero feel better until he thinks it’s his fault Telly’s team doesn’t have any runs. He decides to not be a zero anymore and become a pig instead. This becomes a problem when the Worm Air and Space Agency can’t continue the countdown for the spaceship to blast off. When Big Bird reminds Zero how he helped Alan and Chris, Zero agrees to be himself again and completes the countdown!"

When Abby poofs in to join them, she uses her magic to bring Peter Piper and Prince Paul. Although they are both perfect for the letter “P” game, Peter needs to pick his pickled peppers and Prince Paul needs to find Cinderella. They both need to get back to Fairyland, but Abby hasn’t learned how to send them back. She remembers her mommy saying a rhyme while waving her wand and gives it a try.
