Then Wynton says he will perform not one, but twenty numbers! He plays twenty notes on his trumpet as The Count counts them. He then plays another uptempo riff where The Count is challenged to quickly count to over 230. Biff and Sully & The Hardhats perform next. They perform a song Biff wrote to thank the birds for their beautiful singing called For the Birds. The last performer of the day, Bobby McFerrin, closes with his song called Tweet in the Mornin’."
