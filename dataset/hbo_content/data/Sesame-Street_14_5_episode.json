Oscar unknowingly though cheers him up by letting him know that Big Bird will be in nature having fun along with a nice Counselor to keep him safe. Big Bird also receives a postcard from Snuffelupagus telling Bird that he almost got seen by his friends at Sesame Street! During Bird’s free time, he walks around the camp site to learn the similarities and differences between camp and home. And finally, Counselor Mickey teaches Big Bird and Rusty how to swim!"
