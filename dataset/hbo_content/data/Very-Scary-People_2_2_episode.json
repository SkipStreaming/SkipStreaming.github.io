Using a large caliber. 44 revolver, he unleashed eight horrific shootings across three different boroughs- wounding seven people and killing six. Despite an extraordinary investigation, and hundreds of NYPD officers working the case-- Berkowitz's crime spree lasted over a year. How did he get away with it? What clues did investigators miss? The detectives who worked the case tell the true tale of what it was like in New York City with a gun-toting murderer on the loose."

A killer was on the loose. And though the 1980s were considered the decade of the serial killer – one man stood out. He was the Night Stalker – his crimes were random, vicious, and committed in the name of Satan. His victims ranged from toddlers to the elderly. And as the city was paralyzed with fear, he went unchecked while police struggled to stop him. Then the L.A.P.D get a tip; a teenage boy spotted a suspicious car leaving a crime scene. Would it be enough to bring the night stalker to justice?"
