Telly tosses his lasso and catches a raccoon, who has a paw with a circle in the middle with four ovals fingers. Elmo and Telly also find animal tracks in the shape of two half-moons, but the tracks are from a moose. Telly becomes discouraged but Elmo reminds him that they can’t give up. Elmo realizes they have to find tracks that look like moose tracks but only smaller. They follow some animal tracks that lead to a door and finally they find the cow!"

Although Gabi does not exactly know how to do those things, she introduces them to a new granola bar snack, a new bear song, and different fun games.
