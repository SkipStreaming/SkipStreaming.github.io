But this era of peace and love is shattered when female students began to go missing and their body parts start showing up around town. A frantic public, desperate for answers, live in terror, waiting for the man they dubbed “The Co-Ed Killer” to strike again. But no one could have expected that the person responsible, a local man, Edmund Kemper, was living among them, hiding in plain sight. Told through interview footage with Kemper himself, as well as those who lived through this crippling period, this episode takes viewers back to the time when The Co-Ed Killer brought terror to Santa Cruz."
