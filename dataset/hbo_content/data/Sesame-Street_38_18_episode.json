They say some words that rhyme and when the sparkles clear, Maria disappears, leaving a chicken in her place. To bring Maria back, they try saying another rhyme, and then rhyme in Spanish while hopping, but things only seem to be getting worse. When Abby comes to find her wand, she tries to change Maria back with her rhyme but changes her into a clucking pumpkin! To everyone’s surprise, Maria shows up and it turns out that she was in the hardware store the whole time. The pumpkin was Mrs. Chicken, who was coming to pick up her toaster. With the help of Abby’s mommy, Mrs. Chicken is turned back to normal."
