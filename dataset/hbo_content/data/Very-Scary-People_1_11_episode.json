Not satisfied with just the murders, he also taunted the public with cryptic clues, threats of increased violence and most famously, ciphers that were supposed to lead police to his identity, but mostly went nowhere. Detectives, reporters, and even civilians, have worked for decades to solve the case – but so far, no one has succeeded. Can new DNA techniques that were used to catch the Golden State Killer finally unmask this murderer, who is both infamous and completely unknown?"

Despite an extraordinary investigation, and hundreds of NYPD officers working the case-- Berkowitz's crime spree lasted over a year. How did he get away with it? What clues did investigators miss? The detectives who worked the case tell the true tale of what it was like in New York City with a gun-toting murderer on the loose."

Not satisfied with just the murders, he also taunted the public with cryptic clues, threats of increased violence and most famously, ciphers that were supposed to lead police to his identity, but mostly went nowhere. Detectives, reporters, and even civilians, have worked for decades to solve the case – but so far, no one has succeeded. Can new DNA techniques that were used to catch the Golden State Killer finally unmask this murderer, who is both infamous and completely unknown?"

Using a large caliber. 44 revolver, he unleashed eight horrific shootings across three different boroughs- wounding seven people and killing six. Despite an extraordinary investigation, and hundreds of NYPD officers working the case-- Berkowitz's crime spree lasted over a year. How did he get away with it? What clues did investigators miss? The detectives who worked the case tell the true tale of what it was like in New York City with a gun-toting murderer on the loose."

Terrorized motorists heard of the bullet-ridden victims of the Interstate Killer – but the investigative trail was cold and there was no end in sight. The killer behind the spree was Aileen Wuornos—a complex, misunderstood misfit who hitchhiked near truck stops, selected her victims at random, and lured them to secluded locations. It took good old-fashioned police work, a little luck, and a lover’s betrayal, to finally bring Wuornos’ killing spree to an end. This episode features rare interviews with victims’ family members, and Wuornos’ best friend."
