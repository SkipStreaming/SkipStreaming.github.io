Baby Bear assures Telly not to worry and tries to teach him how to catch. Telly holds out his hands and keeps his eyes on the ball but keeps missing. Even with the help of his other friends, Baby Bear, Rosita and Maria, Telly keeps missing the ball. As Telly is about to give up, Baby Bear comes back with the Manager of the New York Yankees, Joe Torre. Torre encourages Telly by telling him that he is doing everything right but since catching can be a hard thing to learn, he just needs to keep practicing. As Torre leaves, he throws Telly a beach ball and Telly catches it! Telly is thrilled that he caught the ball and continues to practice with Baby Bear."
