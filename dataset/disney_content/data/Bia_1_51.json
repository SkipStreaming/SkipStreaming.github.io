She lives with her parents, Mariano and Alice. Her sister, Helena, died ten years ago in a car accident, or at least that's what everyone's assumed, because her body has never been found. Bia and her sister shared a very strong bond; Bia got her passion for music and singing from her. But she's stopped singing ever since the accident; she has kept her passion to herself as a way of preserving the very special bond they shared. Bia hangs out with her friends at the Fundom, a place for social gathering and artistic creation where they all discover, share and develop their talents. They usually make videos for the Fundom Channel, an outlet for their singing, dancing and creative work that they can share on social media with the help of Pixie, Fundom's manager, a very cheerful and strong-minded gamer.

Bia Urquiza, the main character, is a 16-year-old girl with great imagination and creativity. Bia expresses her art with drawings based on the reality that surrounds her. Together with her best friends and the new friends she meets at the Fundom, Bia embarks on new adventures, falls in love, learns to overcome difficult obstacles and discovers the importance of enjoying life to the fullest and surrounding herself with family and friends. At a time in life when everyone is trying to understand who they are and what they ultimately want, Bia and her friends embark on these quests. They sing, dance, create videos and work together to fulfill their dreams. The biggest challenge ahead is figuring out what each individual really wants and once they discover it, they must learn how to pursue it while being true to themselves. Different from Laix's philosophy, a digital network where the talents are willing to do anything for more followers and fame, the Fundom group will face disappointments and fall but get back on their feet several times, guided by the principle that real success is finding happiness by being yourself. BIA is music, mystery, romance, all entwined with the rhythm of social media networks.","sourceEntity":"series","targetEntity":"series"},{"field":"description","type":"medium","language":"en","content":"Ana hides from Bia and Thiago rescues her.
