back in a trio of all-new, hand-drawn animated shorts from Walt Disney Animation Studios, offering comical insights in “Disney Presents Goofy in How to Stay at Home” as he masters the skills of wearing a mask, learning to cook, and binge watching.

So it seemed only natural to acclaimed master animator/director Eric Goldberg (“Aladdin,” “Pocahontas,” “Fantasia/2000,” “Moana”) that Goofy could provide some good-natured lessons in “How to Stay at Home” and demonstrate how to make the best of today’s challenging situations.  Goldberg directed all three of the films in this series and was the supervising animator on “How to Wear a Mask.”  Joining him were fellow Disney veterans/supervising animators Mark Henn (“Binge Watching”) and Randy Haycock (“Learning to Cook”). The “Disney Presents Goofy in How to Stay at Home” series is produced by Walt Disney Animation Studios veteran/Emmy Award®-winner Dorothy McKim (“Meet the Robinsons,” the “Prep & Landing” television specials, and the Oscar®-nominated short, “Get a Horse!”). Bill Farmer, the voice of Goofy since 1987, provides the familiar vocals for the character, and versatile actor, Corey Burton, is heard as the narrator.","sourceEntity":"season","targetEntity":"season"},{"field":"title","type":"sort","language":"en","content":"long play: how to stay at home","sourceEntity":"program","targetEntity":"program"},{"field":"title","type":"sort","language":"en","content":"presents goofy in how to stay at home, disney","sourceEntity":"season","targetEntity":"season"},{"field":"title","type":"full","language":"en","content":"Disney Presents Goofy in How to Stay at Home","sourceEntity":"series","targetEntity":"series"},{"field":"description","type":"medium","language":"en","content":"Goofy’s back in a trio of all-new, hand-drawn animated shorts from Walt Disney Animation Studios, offering comical insights in “Disney Presents Goofy in How to Stay at Home” as he masters the skills of wearing a mask, learning to cook, and binge watching.
