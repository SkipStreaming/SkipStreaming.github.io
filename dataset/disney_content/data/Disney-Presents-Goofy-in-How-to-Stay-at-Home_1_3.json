back in a trio of all-new, hand-drawn animated shorts offering comical insights on “Disney Presents Goofy in How to Stay at Home” with such topics as mastering the skills of “How to Wear a Mask,” “Learning to Cook,” and “Binge Watching.” Like most of the world, Goofy -- the clumsy, charismatic and lovable Disney “everyman” character who has entertained and “educated” audiences from his screen debut in 1932, his breakout solo short, “Goofy and Wilbur” (1939), a series of popular “how to” shorts in the '40s, to career highlights including “A Goofy Movie” (1995), and the 2007 short “How to Hook Up Your Home Theater” -- spent the last year and a half staying at home. So it seemed only natural to acclaimed master animator/director Eric Goldberg (“Aladdin,” “Pocahontas,” “Fantasia/2000,” “Moana”) that Goofy could provide some good-natured lessons in “How to Stay at Home” and demonstrate how to make the best of today’s challenging situations.  Goldberg directed all three of the films in this series and was the supervising animator on “How to Wear a Mask.”  Joining him were fellow Disney veterans/supervising animators Mark Henn (“Binge Watching”) and Randy Haycock (“Learning to Cook”). The “Disney Presents Goofy in How to Stay at Home” series is produced by Walt Disney Animation Studios veteran/Emmy Award®-winner Dorothy McKim (“Meet the Robinsons,” the “Prep & Landing” television specials, and the Oscar®-nominated short, “Get a Horse!”). Bill Farmer, the voice of Goofy since 1987, provides the familiar vocals for the character, and versatile actor, Corey Burton, is heard as the narrator.","sourceEntity":"season","targetEntity":"season"},{"field":"title","type":"sort","language":"en","content":"binge watching","sourceEntity":"program","targetEntity":"program"},{"field":"description","type":"medium","language":"en","content":"Goofy, like so many others who had to “stay at home” in recent times, finds new ways to binge watch his favorite programs while being flexible enough to multitask a variety of activities.

Goofy is remarkably able to multitask and handle a variety of household activities at the same time that he plants himself in front of his home theater to binge watch his favorite shows. With the skilled hand of versatile veteran Disney animator Mark Henn as supervising animator and direction by the legendary animator/director Eric Goldberg (who created and supervised animation for the character of the Genie in “Aladdin,” co-directed “Pocahontas” and directed two segments of “Fantasia/2000”), this short is a labor of love and a tip of the hat to the classic Goofy “How to” shorts popularized in the 1940s. Most recently, in 2007, Goofy returned to the big screen to show audiences “How to Hook Up Your Home Theater.” The “How to Stay at Home” series is produced by Disney Animation veteran/Emmy Award®-winner Dorothy McKim (“Meet the Robinsons,” the “Prep & Landing” television specials and the Oscar®-nominated short, “Get a Horse!”).
