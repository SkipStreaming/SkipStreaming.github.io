young Deputy Marshal Scott Turner's life is turned upside down when he inherits Hooch, a slobbery mess of a dog. His new pet is a source of constant aggravation, destroying his apartment and threatening his promising career. Despite his misbehavior, Hooch turns out to be surprisingly useful, helping with everything from finding fugitives to protecting witnesses. Scott is desperate to train his new canine partner to be a little less embarrassing, and turns to Erica, a dog trainer with the Marshals. She helps Scott learn to understand and work with Hooch - though he remains completely oblivious to her crush on him. As Scott learns to work with his dog, he gets help and guidance from a pair of more experienced deputies - Jessica Baxter, who does her best to keep Scott focused on what's really important, and the enigmatic Xavier Wilson, an oddball with a lot of wisdom to share. Hooch also turns out to be the key to Scott's love life, as he finds himself at the center of a love triangle with Erica and his long-time crush US Attorney Brooke Mailer. Erica is supportive, fun, totally smitten with him, and Hooch's biggest fan. Scott, however, is more focused on Brooke, who is ambitious, totally focused and less than enthusiastic about Scott's big slobbery dog. While Scott works with the Marshals, he and his sister Laura team up to investigate a mysterious case left unfinished by their father before he died. They don't know what they're looking for, but they know that somehow Scott's new dog is the key to it all. Together with their father's old partner David Sutton, they begin to uncover a serious crime in their sleepy little hometown of Cypress Beach. The clock is ticking, innocent lives are at stake, and the only one who seems to be able to tie it all together is Hooch.

The Chief is unconvinced, however, and points out that Scott's whole case rests on a very shaky foundation: Hooch. Hoping to redeem himself, Scott takes a job with Xavier protecting a robotics lab. They interview the staff at the lab, looking for possible threats. Things go awry, however, when Hooch runs amok, nipping the ankles of the scientists and forcing an evacuation. Brooke tries to convince Scott he shouldn't rely on Hooch so much, but he goes to Erica to try to figure out if his dog is trying to tell them something. When he returns to the lab, however, things go worse, as Hooch gives them no clues and wreaks even more havoc in the lab. In the wake of the disaster, Brooke points out that his canine 'partner' is ruining his career and his future. After an unfortunate incident with a toner cartridge in the office, Scott tells the chief he can't work with Hooch any more and sends him to live with Laura. Heartbroken over betraying his 'forever dog', Scott goes back to work. When a casual comment from Laura tips him off that Hooch may have been on to something after all, Scott races back to the lab. With the help of the new evidence, he and Xavier figure out who is behind the threat and interrupt the thieves mid-heist. They manage to stop the robbery, but Xavier points out to a guilty Scott that they couldn't have done it without Hooch. Scott's defensive, and tries to stick to his decision. The next day, however, he discovers that as much as he thinks he wants a future with Brooke, he can't live without Hooch. Forced to choose between his girlfriend and his dog, he chooses Hooch and heads back to Cypress Beach. Laura, meanwhile, investigates shady trucking company owner Walton with Mayor Sutton and Grady, and discovers that he may have secretly bought a pitbull named Nuke. When they try to find the missing dog, however, Walton stonewalls them. They are out of clues. The trail heats up when Scott sees some suspicious cars on the way back to Cypress Beach. He calls them in to Jessica and follows them out to a remote location, where he discovers that he and Laura were on the right track. He's about to call it in when he's caught and held at gunpoint.","sourceEntity":"program","targetEntity":"program"},{"field":"title","type":"slug","language":"en","content":"turner-hooch","sourceEntity":"series","targetEntity":"series"},{"field":"title","type":"slug","language":"en","content":"hooch-machina","sourceEntity":"program","targetEntity":"program"},{"field":"description","type":"brief","language":"en","content":"A Deputy Marshal inherits an unruly dog who helps him solve crimes and investigate a family mystery.","sourceEntity":"series","targetEntity":"series"},{"field":"title","type":"sort","language":"en","content":"hooch machina","sourceEntity":"program","targetEntity":"program"},{"field":"title","type":"full","language":"en","content":"Turner & Hooch","sourceEntity":"season","targetEntity":"season"},{"field":"title","type":"slug","language":"en","content":"turner-hooch","sourceEntity":"season","targetEntity":"season"},{"field":"description","type":"brief","language":"en","content":"A Deputy Marshal inherits an unruly dog who helps him solve crimes and investigate a family mystery.","sourceEntity":"season","targetEntity":"season"},{"field":"description","type":"full","language":"en","content":"Ambitious young Deputy Marshal Scott Turner's life is turned upside down when he inherits Hooch, a slobbery mess of a dog.
