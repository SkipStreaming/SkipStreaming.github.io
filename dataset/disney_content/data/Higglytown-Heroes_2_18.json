Learning how to fish is fun,  especially when Ferde sings about all the different and funny \"Fishy Wishy\" fish calls you make to bait the fish. Before you know it, the kids catch the biggest fish you have ever seen -- so big, they'll need Pizza Guy's helicopter to carry it back home! But to the gang's chagrin, the helicopter froze into an ice block while they went fishing. The only thing that will melt their troubles away is a team of sled dogs led by a friendly musher. With the sled dogs' help, everyone and the fish get back to Higglytown safe and sound. On a visit with Mr. Gardener, the Higgly kids get some seeds and good instructions for growing their own garden. Back home, the kids get a big surprise when they discover a small colony of penguins playing in their own backyard. Though at first the children are baffled by where they came from, especially since they can't fly, Eubie explains in song that penguins are birds from the South Pole, and fly underwater rather than in the air. Things get a little a little out of control when the penguins start overcrowding the backyard and making a mess of the kids' garden. To get things back in order they'll need the help of animal control to get these rowdy \"waddlers\" back to where they belong.","sourceEntity":"program","targetEntity":"program"}],"type":"DmcVideo","typedGenres":[],"videoArt":[],"videoId":"a8227221-c666-4841-b2aa-902a009ee1dd"}}}}
